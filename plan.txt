ORIGINAL SPECS

Spending Tracker
-Build an app that allows a user to track their spending.

MVP
-The app should allow the user to create, edit and delete merchants, e.g. Tesco, Amazon, ScotRail
-The app should allow the user to create, edit and delete tags for their spending, e.g. groceries, entertainment, transport
-The user should be able to assign tags and merchants to a transaction, as well as an amount spent on each transaction.
-The app should display all the transactions a user has made in a single view, with each transaction's amount, merchant and tag, and a total for all transactions.

EXTENSIONS
-Transactions should have a timestamp, and the user should be able to view transactions sorted by the time they took place.
-The user should be able to supply a budget, and the app should alert the user somehow when when they are nearing this budget or have gone over it.
-The user should be able to filter their view of transactions, for example, to view all transactions in a given month, or view all spending on groceries.
